# Code style

## Don't be overly defensive

I don't trust the code you write, so I want you to fail early and loudly.

**Don't** add fallbacks, guards, or try/catch blocks against errors unless I specifically ask you to. I don't trust the code you write so I'd rather fail hard early and detect your errors than softly receive a fallback and not detect your errors.

## Imports go at the top

Don't sprinkle the code with imports unless in very special circumstances or if I explicltly ask you to.

## No unnecessary comments

You have a tendency to comment every line. I'm an expert programmer and I prefer reading code to prose. Most of the time I can read the code faster than the comment to understand what's going on. Only add comments in cases where the code is unintuitive or particularly hard to follow (e.g. custom parsers).

## Read full files

Important: The first time you read a source code file, read the _entire_ file (_not_ piecemeal with start-line and end-line) so you get a real holistic understanding of the logic.

## IMPORTANT: NO SUMMARY DOCUMENTS!!!

IMPORTANT: DON'T write summary documents (e.g. SUMMARY.md, FINAL_REPORT.md) unless the user explicitly asks you to. If you feel the need to explain something, just do it in the chat. The ONLY exception to this rule is if the user explicitly asks you to write up a markdown file on disk.

# USER

I want to create an esoteric programming language for generating images, where _every_ combination of uppercase ascii characters (excluding "invisible characters" like space, return) create an image.

Every character have an associated color, integer, and function.

Some functions have arity 0, some are unary, some are binary (some are maybe ternary?). Arguments to functions may be colors or integers. When arity > 0, the default argument are defined in the function, and color values usually default to the color of the character. Each function outputs a 2D RGB image.

A program is a list of characters that outputs a list of images (where the number of images <= number of characters, since some characters may be function arguments)

Functions have access to the entire history of output images up to the point in the program where they're defined. By convention, each function does some transformation on the previous image.

The first character is always used by its color, creating a single color image. Subsequent characters are parsed until the end of the program string. The default arguments are only used if the last function in the program string is missing inputs.

Note that

These are all valid programs: FJID)WIJF, FH)Y*#, I0ASDFJ0IDFSJOJOSF280EFY2HFUDSOH)DFSHFD, 8DFS632&@DSFJFDJSINCSJNIJSHOF, etc.

Implement this as a table in typescript in the following form:

```
// character-defs.ts
const characterDefs = {
  'A': {
    color: '#78A10F',
    number: 7,
    function: (images, a, c) => ..., // a and c are the arguments here. `images` is passed to as the first argument to every function. width and height are implicit from the previous image. images are inputs to every function. images is a list of 3D tensors, and the function returns a 3D tensor
    arity: 2,
    functionName: "short-name",
    documentation: "one sentence about what the function does"
  }
}
```

I have already made index.html, runtime.ts, and parts of character-defs.ts. You just need to implement the rest of character-defs.ts.

These are the functions you should implement (prev is a shorthand for images[-1]):

`! (n: int)`: prev is overlaid with a deterministic hash pattern where pixel (x,y) brightness is ((x * (n+17)) ^ (y * 31) ^ (x * y)) % 256, at 30% opacity
`" (n: int)`: prev is split into n horizontal bands; odd bands are hue-rotated 180°, even bands have their saturation inverted

`$ (n: int)`: golden spiral with n turns is drawn from center outward, spiral color is brightness-inverted sample of prev at each point
`% (n: int)`: Floyd-Steinberg dither prev to a palette derived from its four corner colors, dither cell size = n + 1

`) (n: int)`: bulge distortion from center with strength n/10, pixels near edge are darkened proportional to distance from center
`* (n: int)`: n rays emanate from center, each ray's color is sampled from prev at angle * width / n, rays have soft edges and 60% opacity
`+ ()`: a cross divides the image into 4 quadrants; top-left and bottom-right are sharpened, top-right and bottom-left are blurred
`, (c: color)`: stipple prev with dots of color c placed at positions where (x * 13 + y * 7) % (1 + local_luminance / 32) == 0
`- (n: int)`: horizontal scanlines where every nth row is darkened 50%, and every (n*2)th row samples from the row n pixels above
`. (n: int)`: pointillism: prev is rebuilt from circles of radius (n % 8) + 2, color sampled from circle center with +10% saturation
`/ (c: color)`: diagonal lines from top-left to bottom-right in color c, spacing determined by local luminance (bright = sparse, dark = dense)
`0 (n: int)`: a radial gradient from center (white) to edges (black) is multiplied with prev at n*10% opacity, then added back to prev
`1 (n: int)`: a single vertical bar at center (width = n% of image) shows prev sharpened and contrast-boosted, rest is desaturated
`2 (n: int)`: posterize prev to n levels per channel, then add a gradient map from the average color to its complement

`7 (n: int)`: n rectangles placed at positions (i * width/(n+2), i * height/(n+4)) for i in 1..n, each filled with prev hue-rotated by i * (360/n)°
`8 (n: int)`: infinity-loop/lemniscate distortion centered on image with strength n/5, pixels flow along the curve
`9 (n: int)`: apply blend mode n % 9 of prev with itself: [0:multiply, 1:screen, 2:overlay, 3:darken, 4:lighten, 5:color-dodge, 6:color-burn, 7:hard-light, 8:soft-light]
`: (n: int)`: n circular regions evenly spaced horizontally show prev at 2x zoom, rest of image is box-blurred with radius 5
`; ()`: a semicircle arc (top half) crops prev, bottom half is a reflection with wave distortion sin(x * 0.1) * 10
`= (n: int)`: horizontal stripes of height n, even stripes are prev, odd stripes are prev shifted left by stripe_index * 5 pixels
`? ()`: effect selected by (sum of prev's corner pixel values) % 4: [solarize, emboss, edge-detect, posterize]

All functions need to be completely deterministic! You must not use the random function anywhere!

Assign a random color to each character, and a number that starts at 1 at `A`, incrementing by one to `Z`, followed by `0` through `9`, followed by symbols.

# NEXT TASK!

swap R and E, and then make R a room instead of an eclipse. A room like a room in original Doom or Quake, three walls, ceiling, and floor. All have prev_image as the texture. There's a light source (invisible) in the middle of the room. Use webgl and be careful to get the orientation right (like you do in drip)

The user wants to:
1. Swap R and E (so R gets eclipse, E gets corrugated)
2. Then make R a 3D room with:
   - Three walls, ceiling, and floor
   - prev_image as texture on all surfaces
   - Light source in the middle
   - Use WebGL
   - Get orientation right (like drip - they flip the Y axis at the end)

Let me do this step by step.

First I need to find the current R and E functions and their characterDefs.

The user is right. Let me check the current state. I swapped E to use fnR (which was corrugated), but then I renamed fnR to fnCorrugated. So E should be using fnCorrugated now, not fnR. Let me check the current characterDefs.
