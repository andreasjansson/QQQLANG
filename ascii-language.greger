# Code style

## Don't be overly defensive

I don't trust the code you write, so I want you to fail early and loudly.

**Don't** add fallbacks, guards, or try/catch blocks against errors unless I specifically ask you to. I don't trust the code you write so I'd rather fail hard early and detect your errors than softly receive a fallback and not detect your errors.

## Imports go at the top

Don't sprinkle the code with imports unless in very special circumstances or if I explicltly ask you to.

## No unnecessary comments

You have a tendency to comment every line. I'm an expert programmer and I prefer reading code to prose. Most of the time I can read the code faster than the comment to understand what's going on. Only add comments in cases where the code is unintuitive or particularly hard to follow (e.g. custom parsers).

## Read full files

Important: The first time you read a source code file, read the _entire_ file (_not_ piecemeal with start-line and end-line) so you get a real holistic understanding of the logic.

## IMPORTANT: NO SUMMARY DOCUMENTS!!!

IMPORTANT: DON'T write summary documents (e.g. SUMMARY.md, FINAL_REPORT.md) unless the user explicitly asks you to. If you feel the need to explain something, just do it in the chat. The ONLY exception to this rule is if the user explicitly asks you to write up a markdown file on disk.

# USER

I want to create an esoteric programming language for generating images, where _every_ combination of uppercase ascii characters (excluding "invisible characters" like space, return) create an image.

Every character have an associated color, integer, and function.

Some functions have arity 0, some are unary, some are binary (some are maybe ternary?). Arguments to functions may be colors or integers. When arity > 0, the default argument are defined in the function, and color values usually default to the color of the character. Each function outputs a 2D RGB image.

A program is a list of characters that outputs a list of images (where the number of images <= number of characters, since some characters may be function arguments)

Functions have access to the entire history of output images up to the point in the program where they're defined. By convention, each function does some transformation on the previous image.

The first character is always used by its color, creating a single color image. Subsequent characters are parsed until the end of the program string. The default arguments are only used if the last function in the program string is missing inputs.

Note that

These are all valid programs: FJID)WIJF, FH)Y*#, I0ASDFJ0IDFSJOJOSF280EFY2HFUDSOH)DFSHFD, 8DFS632&@DSFJFDJSINCSJNIJSHOF, etc.

Implement this as a table in typescript in the following form:

```
// character-defs.ts
const characterDefs = {
  'A': {
    color: '#78A10F',
    number: 7,
    function: (images, a, c) => ..., // a and c are the arguments here. `images` is passed to as the first argument to every function. width and height are implicit from the previous image. images are inputs to every function. images is a list of 3D tensors, and the function returns a 3D tensor
    arity: 2,
    functionName: "short-name",
    documentation: "one sentence about what the function does"
  }
}
```

I have already made index.html, runtime.ts, and parts of character-defs.ts. You just need to implement the rest of character-defs.ts.

These are the functions you should implement (prev is a shorthand for images[-1]):

`! (n: int)`: prev is overlaid with a deterministic hash pattern where pixel (x,y) brightness is ((x * (n+17)) ^ (y * 31) ^ (x * y)) % 256, at 30% opacity
`" (n: int)`: prev is split into n horizontal bands; odd bands are hue-rotated 180°, even bands have their saturation inverted

`$ (n: int)`: golden spiral with n turns is drawn from center outward, spiral color is brightness-inverted sample of prev at each point
`% (n: int)`: Floyd-Steinberg dither prev to a palette derived from its four corner colors, dither cell size = n + 1

`) (n: int)`: bulge distortion from center with strength n/10, pixels near edge are darkened proportional to distance from center
`* (n: int)`: n rays emanate from center, each ray's color is sampled from prev at angle * width / n, rays have soft edges and 60% opacity
`+ ()`: a cross divides the image into 4 quadrants; top-left and bottom-right are sharpened, top-right and bottom-left are blurred
`, (c: color)`: stipple prev with dots of color c placed at positions where (x * 13 + y * 7) % (1 + local_luminance / 32) == 0
`- (n: int)`: horizontal scanlines where every nth row is darkened 50%, and every (n*2)th row samples from the row n pixels above
`. (n: int)`: pointillism: prev is rebuilt from circles of radius (n % 8) + 2, color sampled from circle center with +10% saturation
`/ (c: color)`: diagonal lines from top-left to bottom-right in color c, spacing determined by local luminance (bright = sparse, dark = dense)
`0 (n: int)`: a radial gradient from center (white) to edges (black) is multiplied with prev at n*10% opacity, then added back to prev
`1 (n: int)`: a single vertical bar at center (width = n% of image) shows prev sharpened and contrast-boosted, rest is desaturated
`2 (n: int)`: posterize prev to n levels per channel, then add a gradient map from the average color to its complement

`7 (n: int)`: n rectangles placed at positions (i * width/(n+2), i * height/(n+4)) for i in 1..n, each filled with prev hue-rotated by i * (360/n)°
`8 (n: int)`: infinity-loop/lemniscate distortion centered on image with strength n/5, pixels flow along the curve
`9 (n: int)`: apply blend mode n % 9 of prev with itself: [0:multiply, 1:screen, 2:overlay, 3:darken, 4:lighten, 5:color-dodge, 6:color-burn, 7:hard-light, 8:soft-light]
`: (n: int)`: n circular regions evenly spaced horizontally show prev at 2x zoom, rest of image is box-blurred with radius 5
`; ()`: a semicircle arc (top half) crops prev, bottom half is a reflection with wave distortion sin(x * 0.1) * 10
`= (n: int)`: horizontal stripes of height n, even stripes are prev, odd stripes are prev shifted left by stripe_index * 5 pixels
`? ()`: effect selected by (sum of prev's corner pixel values) % 4: [solarize, emboss, edge-detect, posterize]

All functions need to be completely deterministic! You must not use the random function anywhere!

Assign a random color to each character, and a number that starts at 1 at `A`, incrementing by one to `Z`, followed by `0` through `9`, followed by symbols.

# NEXT TASK

Replace E with an emerald function that generates bright well-lit reflective realistic 3D (webgl) emeralds in a symmetric pattern with a large emerald in the middle and other emeralds (all in the same top-down orientation) on the sides. The function takes no argument.

(context compacted)

I have a model in ~/projects/ascii-language/emerald.glb, use that, and make the material glassy and shiny and transparent and translucent.

The user has a GLB model file for the emerald. I need to load this 3D model and render it with WebGL instead of using raymarching. GLB is a binary glTF format.

Let me first look at the GLB file to understand its structure, then modify the fnE function to load and render the model with proper glassy/shiny/transparent/translucent materials.

First, let me check if there are any existing utilities for loading GLB files in the project, or if I need to implement one.

Now I need to create a new implementation that loads the GLB model. GLB parsing is complex, so I'll need to add a GLB loader. Let me create the new fnE function that loads the model:

surely there are libraries to load glb files into webgl?

The user is right - there are libraries like Three.js or gltf-loader that can load GLB files. Since this is a browser-based project, I should use a library. Three.js is the most popular choice for 3D WebGL rendering and includes GLTFLoader.

Let me check the index.html to see how the project is structured and how to add Three.js.

You're right! Three.js is the standard choice for this. Let me check the project setup:

The user has installed three.js. Now I need to rewrite the fnE function to use Three.js to load the GLB model and render it with a glassy, shiny, transparent, translucent material.

I'll need to:
1. Import Three.js and GLTFLoader
2. Create a Three.js scene, camera, renderer
3. Load the emerald.glb model
4. Apply a glassy/transparent material (MeshPhysicalMaterial with transmission, roughness, etc.)
5. Render to a texture and read it back

Since the functions need to return an Image synchronously but GLB loading is async, I might need to cache the loaded model. Let me think about this...

Actually, looking at the existing code, the functions are synchronous. But Three.js model loading is asynchronous. I'll need to:
1. Pre-load the model and cache it
2. Have the function use the cached model

Or I could use a synchronous approach by embedding the geometry data, but that's not ideal.

Let me create a solution that:
1. Loads the model asynchronously on first call
2. Caches the geometry
3. Renders synchronously using the cached geometry

I'll need to add imports at the top of the file for Three.js.

Now let me rewrite the fnE function to use Three.js. I'll need to add imports and create a new implementation:

The model loading is async so on the first render it returns early with the prev image. Let me check what's happening. The issue could be:

1. The model path might be wrong - it's looking for '/emerald.glb' but Vite might serve it differently
2. The async loading means on first call it returns the prev image
3. The camera/scene setup might not be showing the model properly

Let me debug this. First, let me check if there are any console errors or if the model is loading at all. I should also consider that after the model loads, the render function needs to be called again.

Actually, the main issue is probably that after the model loads, there's nothing triggering a re-render. The function returns `cloneImage(prev)` while loading, but once loaded, the user would need to type something to trigger a re-render.

But also, I should check:
1. The model path - Vite serves static files from the public folder or root
2. The Three.js setup might have issues

Let me add some debugging and fix potential issues.

Check the browser console. The issue is that after the model loads asynchronously, nothing triggers a re-render. You need to type something (like adding/removing a character) to trigger the render again.

But there might also be issues with the Three.js setup. Let me simplify and add a test cube to verify rendering works:

# ASSISTANT

Can you check the browser console and tell me what it says? Also try typing a character after "E" (like "EA") and then deleting it to force a re-render after the model loads.

# USER

no fallbacks! either emerald or throw an error

I can see from the logs that the model loaded successfully and the render function ran ("Adding emerald models to scene"). But the emerald isn't showing. This could be:

1. The rendered output isn't being captured correctly
2. The camera position/orientation is wrong
3. The model scale is too small or positioned outside the camera view
4. The Three.js renderer isn't working properly

Let me check if there's an issue with the pixel reading or the render itself. The user also wants me to throw an error instead of using fallbacks.

Let me fix the code to:
1. Remove fallbacks - throw if model not loaded
2. Debug why the render isn't working

The issue might be that when the model is loaded, it gets centered and scaled, but then when we clone it in fnE, we're not accounting for that. Also, I should check if the background/environment setup is correct.

Let me also check if the renderer is actually rendering anything by adding more debugging.

# ASSISTANT

I see - the model loaded and the render code ran, but nothing shows up. Let me fix the code - remove the fallback and debug the rendering issue:

Now try again and check the console. After the model loads, make a small change to the input (add/remove a character) to trigger a re-render. Tell me what the "Non-zero pixels" count is.

I can see the issue now:
1. The model loads successfully
2. When rendering, we get "Non-zero pixels: 15840 out of 45000" - so there ARE pixels being rendered!
3. But the image isn't showing up on screen

The issue must be in how we handle the output. Let me check the pixel flipping logic and the output. The Three.js renderer is rendering something (35% of pixels are non-zero), but it's not showing on screen.

Wait, looking at the code, we're reading pixels correctly and flipping them. But maybe the issue is that the result is being stored in the cache and returned, but something is wrong with the image data format.

Let me also check if the background texture is being applied correctly. The prev image should be showing as the background.

Actually, let me look at the flip logic more carefully. We're reading from (ctx.height - 1 - y) and putting into y. That should be correct.

Let me add more debugging to see what's actually in the pixel data.

# ASSISTANT

We're getting pixels rendered (15840 non-zero out of 45000 = ~35%). So Three.js IS rendering something, but it's not showing up. Let me check what the actual pixel values look like:

Run it again and show me the new debug output. I want to see the max RGBA values and center pixel values.

The pixel data looks correct:
- Max RGBA values: 235 231 119 255 (yellowish color, which makes sense with the background)
- Center pixel: 235 227 109 255 (similar yellowish)
- 15840 non-zero pixels out of 45000
- The flipped data also looks correct

So the data IS there with valid pixel values. The issue must be in how the image is displayed on the main canvas. Let me check the index.html to see how images are rendered...

Looking at index.html:
```javascript
const imageData = new ImageData(finalImage.data, finalImage.width, finalImage.height);
ctx.putImageData(imageData, 0, 0);
```

This should work correctly. The Image format we return has `data: Uint8ClampedArray` which is exactly what ImageData expects.

Wait, actually looking more carefully - the center pixel is yellowish (235 227 109), which looks like just the background. The emeralds should show up as green. But the background is showing through, which suggests the emeralds might not be in view or are too small.

Actually wait - the user says "the emerald just isn't appearing at all" - so maybe the issue is that what's being shown is ONLY the background without the emeralds. The pixels are non-zero because of the background texture.

Let me think about this:
1. The background texture is being rendered (yellowish pixels = the prev image background)
2. But the emerald models might not be visible

Possible issues:
1. Camera is not pointed at the emeralds
2. Emeralds are too small or in the wrong position
3. The emerald material is fully transparent
4. The emerald model geometry is problematic

Let me try a simpler approach - render with a solid background color (not the texture) and see if the emeralds show up. If they don't, then it's a model/camera issue.


I'll investigate the model's dimensions and positioning. The bounds might reveal why the emeralds aren't visible. Checking the logged model bounds could expose scaling or placement problems that are hiding the emeralds from view. The scene setup might be preventing the emeralds from rendering correctly, potentially due to incorrect transformation or positioning when cloning the original model.

The background could be obscuring everything, which means I need to carefully manage scene children and ensure the emeralds aren't being completely covered. Debugging with a simple background color will help isolate whether the issue is with the emerald models themselves or how they're being added to the scene.

I'll test rendering the emeralds with a solid material to eliminate any transparency-related rendering complications and verify their basic visibility.

# ASSISTANT

The pixel data is there (center pixel: 235 227 109 255 - that's yellowish, which is the background color). So the background is rendering but the emeralds aren't visible. Let me simplify the material to debug - make them solid green first:

The emeralds are now visible with the simple green material. So the issue was with the MeshPhysicalMaterial - probably the transmission/transparency settings weren't working correctly, or needed additional setup (like environment maps for reflections).

Now I need to make the material glassy, shiny, transparent and translucent while still being visible. Let me restore a proper material but with better settings that will actually work.

For MeshPhysicalMaterial with transmission to work properly, we need:
1. A proper environment map for reflections
2. The renderer needs to support it

Let me try a different approach - use a material that looks glassy but isn't fully dependent on transmission. I can use:
- Lower transmission value
- Higher opacity
- Good specular/clearcoat settings
- Proper environment map

Or I could try using a custom shader approach, but let's first try fixing the MeshPhysicalMaterial settings.

# ASSISTANT

Excellent! Now we know the geometry is working. The issue was with the transparent/transmissive material. Let me restore a proper glassy material that will actually render correctly:
