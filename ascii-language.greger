# Code style

## Don't be overly defensive

I don't trust the code you write, so I want you to fail early and loudly.

**Don't** add fallbacks, guards, or try/catch blocks against errors unless I specifically ask you to. I don't trust the code you write so I'd rather fail hard early and detect your errors than softly receive a fallback and not detect your errors.

## Imports go at the top

Don't sprinkle the code with imports unless in very special circumstances or if I explicltly ask you to.

## No unnecessary comments

You have a tendency to comment every line. I'm an expert programmer and I prefer reading code to prose. Most of the time I can read the code faster than the comment to understand what's going on. Only add comments in cases where the code is unintuitive or particularly hard to follow (e.g. custom parsers).

## Read full files

Important: The first time you read a source code file, read the _entire_ file (_not_ piecemeal with start-line and end-line) so you get a real holistic understanding of the logic.

## IMPORTANT: NO SUMMARY DOCUMENTS!!!

IMPORTANT: DON'T write summary documents (e.g. SUMMARY.md, FINAL_REPORT.md) unless the user explicitly asks you to. If you feel the need to explain something, just do it in the chat. The ONLY exception to this rule is if the user explicitly asks you to write up a markdown file on disk.

# USER

I want to create an esoteric programming language for generating images, where _every_ combination of uppercase ascii characters (excluding "invisible characters" like space, return) create an image.

Every character have an associated color, integer, and function.

Some functions have arity 0, some are unary, some are binary (some are maybe ternary?). Arguments to functions may be colors or integers. When arity > 0, the default argument are defined in the function, and color values usually default to the color of the character. Each function outputs a 2D RGB image.

A program is a list of characters that outputs a list of images (where the number of images <= number of characters, since some characters may be function arguments)

Functions have access to the entire history of output images up to the point in the program where they're defined. By convention, each function does some transformation on the previous image.

The first character is always used by its color, creating a single color image. Subsequent characters are parsed until the end of the program string. The default arguments are only used if the last function in the program string is missing inputs.

Note that

These are all valid programs: FJID)WIJF, FH)Y*#, I0ASDFJ0IDFSJOJOSF280EFY2HFUDSOH)DFSHFD, 8DFS632&@DSFJFDJSINCSJNIJSHOF, etc.

Implement this as a table in typescript in the following form:

```
// character-defs.ts
const characterDefs = {
  'A': {
    color: '#78A10F',
    number: 7,
    function: (images, a, c) => ..., // a and c are the arguments here. `images` is passed to as the first argument to every function. width and height are implicit from the previous image. images are inputs to every function. images is a list of 3D tensors, and the function returns a 3D tensor
    arity: 2,
    functionName: "short-name",
    documentation: "one sentence about what the function does"
  }
}
```

I have already made index.html, runtime.ts, and parts of character-defs.ts. You just need to implement the rest of character-defs.ts.

These are the functions you should implement (prev is a shorthand for images[-1]):

`! (n: int)`: prev is overlaid with a deterministic hash pattern where pixel (x,y) brightness is ((x * (n+17)) ^ (y * 31) ^ (x * y)) % 256, at 30% opacity
`" (n: int)`: prev is split into n horizontal bands; odd bands are hue-rotated 180°, even bands have their saturation inverted

`$ (n: int)`: golden spiral with n turns is drawn from center outward, spiral color is brightness-inverted sample of prev at each point
`% (n: int)`: Floyd-Steinberg dither prev to a palette derived from its four corner colors, dither cell size = n + 1

`) (n: int)`: bulge distortion from center with strength n/10, pixels near edge are darkened proportional to distance from center
`* (n: int)`: n rays emanate from center, each ray's color is sampled from prev at angle * width / n, rays have soft edges and 60% opacity
`+ ()`: a cross divides the image into 4 quadrants; top-left and bottom-right are sharpened, top-right and bottom-left are blurred
`, (c: color)`: stipple prev with dots of color c placed at positions where (x * 13 + y * 7) % (1 + local_luminance / 32) == 0
`- (n: int)`: horizontal scanlines where every nth row is darkened 50%, and every (n*2)th row samples from the row n pixels above
`. (n: int)`: pointillism: prev is rebuilt from circles of radius (n % 8) + 2, color sampled from circle center with +10% saturation
`/ (c: color)`: diagonal lines from top-left to bottom-right in color c, spacing determined by local luminance (bright = sparse, dark = dense)
`0 (n: int)`: a radial gradient from center (white) to edges (black) is multiplied with prev at n*10% opacity, then added back to prev
`1 (n: int)`: a single vertical bar at center (width = n% of image) shows prev sharpened and contrast-boosted, rest is desaturated
`2 (n: int)`: posterize prev to n levels per channel, then add a gradient map from the average color to its complement

`7 (n: int)`: n rectangles placed at positions (i * width/(n+2), i * height/(n+4)) for i in 1..n, each filled with prev hue-rotated by i * (360/n)°
`8 (n: int)`: infinity-loop/lemniscate distortion centered on image with strength n/5, pixels flow along the curve
`9 (n: int)`: apply blend mode n % 9 of prev with itself: [0:multiply, 1:screen, 2:overlay, 3:darken, 4:lighten, 5:color-dodge, 6:color-burn, 7:hard-light, 8:soft-light]
`: (n: int)`: n circular regions evenly spaced horizontally show prev at 2x zoom, rest of image is box-blurred with radius 5
`; ()`: a semicircle arc (top half) crops prev, bottom half is a reflection with wave distortion sin(x * 0.1) * 10
`= (n: int)`: horizontal stripes of height n, even stripes are prev, odd stripes are prev shifted left by stripe_index * 5 pixels
`? ()`: effect selected by (sum of prev's corner pixel values) % 4: [solarize, emboss, edge-detect, posterize]

All functions need to be completely deterministic! You must not use the random function anywhere!

Assign a random color to each character, and a number that starts at 1 at `A`, incrementing by one to `Z`, followed by `0` through `9`, followed by symbols.

The user wants me to implement characters 0-9 in character-defs.ts. Let me look at the specifications for each:

`0 (n: int)`: a radial gradient from center (white) to edges (black) is multiplied with prev at n*10% opacity, then added back to prev
`1 (n: int)`: a single vertical bar at center (width = n% of image) shows prev sharpened and contrast-boosted, rest is desaturated
`2 (n: int)`: posterize prev to n levels per channel, then add a gradient map from the average color to its complement
`3 ()`: prev is divided into 3 vertical strips; left strip rotated 90° CW, middle unchanged, right strip rotated 90° CCW, all scaled to fit
`4 ()`: prev is divided into 2x2 quadrants, each rotated (0°, 90°, 180°, 270°) respectively, seams blended with 5px feather
`5 (n: int)`: triangular tiling with cell size n*10, each tile's fill is sampled from prev at tile center, edges drawn in inverted colors
`6 (n: int)`: hexagonal pixelation with hex cell radius n*5, each filled with region's average color, edges drawn 1px darker
`7 (n: int)`: n rectangles placed at positions (i * width/(n+2), i * height/(n+4)) for i in 1..n, each filled with prev hue-rotated by i * (360/n)°
`8 (n: int)`: infinity-loop/lemniscate distortion centered on image with strength n/5, pixels flow along the curve
`9 (n: int)`: apply blend mode n % 9 of prev with itself: [0:multiply, 1:screen, 2:overlay, 3:darken, 4:lighten, 5:color-dodge, 6:color-burn, 7:hard-light, 8:soft-light]


I'll map the alphabetic and numeric characters to their corresponding numeric values. A starts at 1, with Z being 26, and then 0-9 will map to 27-36.

The user wants me to remove the argument from the '1' function. Looking at the spec:
`1 (n: int)`: a single vertical bar at center (width = n% of image) shows prev sharpened and contrast-boosted, rest is desaturated

But the user wants it to have no arguments (arity 0). Let me update both the function definition and the characterDef entry.

The user wants me to replace the fn2 function with something more interesting that works with thirds of the screen. Let me think of something visually interesting...

Some ideas:
1. Split into thirds horizontally, each third has a different color channel emphasized (R, G, B)
2. Split into thirds, each with different time-shifted versions or effects
3. Split into thirds with different blend modes
4. Thirds with different rotations or mirrors
5. Thirds where each shows the image at different zoom levels
6. Thirds with different color temperature (warm, neutral, cool)
7. RGB channel separation - left third shows red channel, middle shows green, right shows blue

I think the RGB channel separation idea is cool and visually striking. Let me implement that.

Done. The `2` function now splits the image into three vertical thirds, showing only the red channel on the left, green in the middle, and blue on the right.

# USER

rgb split is boring. give me five other suggestions

(context compacted)

Swap 5 and D and rename melt to drip

The user wants me to:
1. Swap the functions for '5' and 'D' characters
2. Rename "melt" to "drip" in the function name/documentation

So '5' should get what 'D' currently has, and 'D' should get what '5' currently has (the metaball drip effect).

Let me find both character definitions and swap them.

# ASSISTANT

Done! Swapped the functions:
- `D` now has the drip effect (formerly melt, renamed to "drip")
- `5` now has the triangular-split effect

# USER

Make the random seed to melt dependent on the number of input images so ADDDDDDDD doesn't just add new drips at the same places, but it's still deterministic

The user wants the drip effect (now on 'D') to have a different random seed based on the number of input images. This way, calling D multiple times (like ADDDDDDDD) will produce drips at different positions each time, but it's still deterministic based on how many images are in the history.

I need to modify fn5 (which is now used by 'D') to use ctx.images.length or ctx.currentIndex as part of the random seed.

Let me find the fn5 function and add the image count to the hash seed.

Done! Now the drip effect uses `ctx.images.length * 137.5` as a seed, so each successive call to D (like in `ADDDDDDDD`) will generate drips at different positions while remaining deterministic.

# USER

In index.html, automatically uppercase a-z, and don't allow entering any non-defined characters (alert with a visual bell)

The user wants me to modify index.html to:
1. Automatically uppercase a-z input
2. Don't allow entering any non-defined characters (characters not in characterDefs)
3. Show a visual bell alert when trying to enter invalid characters

I need to read index.html first to understand the current structure, then modify the input handler.

The user is saying that LLL and LLM look the same. Let me check the function more carefully. The issue might be that the angleVariation parameter is the third argument, but I need to verify how the function is being called and whether the argument is actually being used.

Let me look at the full fnL function and the character definition for L.

I see - there's a variable shadowing issue! Inside `growBranch`, there's a local variable `angleVariation` that shadows the parameter. But the real issue is that `L` with number 12 is being used. Looking at `LLL` - the first L is a solid color, then the second L calls fnL with L's number (12) for the second arg. And `LLM` would use M's number (13) for the second arg.

The difference between 12 and 13 for recursionDepth should be visible... but wait, let me check how the parser works. Let me trace through:

- `LLL`: First L = solid color. Second L = fnL(color=L.color, recursionDepth=L.number=12, angleVariation=L.number=12)
- `LLM`: First L = solid color. Second L = fnL(color=L.color, recursionDepth=L.number=12, angleVariation=M.number=13)

So `LLL` vs `LLM` changes the third argument, not the second. To change the second argument between the two, user would need `LML` vs `LLL`.

But actually, wait - the function appears to work with the depth check `if (depth > maxDepth || length < 8)`. If maxDepth is 12 or 13, that's a lot of recursion. The `length < 8` check might be stopping it earlier. Let me check if there's something else limiting it.

Actually, looking more closely - the length shrinks by `length * (0.4 + rand() * 0.35)` each recursion, so max 0.75x. Starting at `ctx.height * 0.7`, after say 10 iterations it would be `0.7 * height * 0.75^10 ≈ 0.04 * height`. For a 1000px height, that's 40px, still > 8. But after 15 it would be about 10px, so it could hit the length limit.

The real issue might be that the branches aren't growing much because of other constraints. Let me trace more carefully...

Actually, I think I see it now - the function uses the same `rand` seeded random generator for everything, so the pattern is deterministic. The issue might be that increasing maxDepth from 12 to 13 doesn't add much visibly because:
1. Many branches already terminate due to `length < 8`
2. Or going out of bounds

Let me check if the user's issue is actually that the values for L.number = 12 and M.number = 13 are so close that the visual difference is minimal.

So L.number=12 and M.number=13. The difference between maxDepth 12 and 13 is pretty small visually since the recursion likely hits other limits first.

But actually, the user said they're testing `LLL` vs `LLM`. In both cases:
- First char L creates solid color
- Second char L calls fnL with args from subsequent chars

For `LLL`: fnL(c=L.color, recursionDepth=L.number=12, angleVariation=L.number=12)
For `LLM`: fnL(c=L.color, recursionDepth=L.number=12, angleVariation=M.number=13)

So the difference is in the THIRD argument (angleVariation), not the second. The user said they meant the second argument... so they might want to test `LAL` vs `LML` or similar to see a difference in the second arg.

But regardless, even 12 vs 13 for angleVariation should show SOME difference. Unless... let me look at the math again:

`angleVar = Math.max(0.1, angleVariation * 0.15)`

So for 12: angleVar = 12 * 0.15 = 1.8
For 13: angleVar = 13 * 0.15 = 1.95

That's a pretty subtle difference in radians (about 103° vs 112°).

Actually wait, the user says they're not seeing "any" difference. That suggests something might be fundamentally wrong. Let me think...

Oh! I think the issue might be the parser or how arity works. Let me check the runtime to see how arguments are passed.

Actually, let me just ask the user what they're expecting or test by looking at what params would actually differ.

Let me just respond and ask for clarification on what they're testing and expecting to see different.

Actually, looking at the code more carefully - after `LLL`, if L has arity 3, then:
- First L: solid color (always)
- Second L: function call, consumes next 3 chars as args... but there's only 1 char left (the third L)

So for `LLL`:
- Char 0 (L): solid color #20B2AA
- Char 1 (L): fnL, needs 3 args, only 1 remaining char
  - arg0 (color): from char 2 (L) -> L.color = '#20B2AA'
  - arg1 (int): no char, use default L.number = 12
  - arg2 (int): no char, use default L.number = 12

For `LLM`:
- Char 0 (L): solid color
- Char 1 (L): fnL, needs 3 args, only 1 remaining char
  - arg0 (color): from char 2 (M) -> M.color = '#FF69B4'
  - arg1 (int): no char, use default L.number = 12
  - arg2 (int): no char, use default L.number = 12

So actually both use the same recursionDepth (12) and angleVariation (12) because they're both defaults from L! The only difference is the COLOR of the Lichtenberg figure.

So the user is right - changing the 3rd character from L to M doesn't change the second argument (recursionDepth), it changes the FIRST argument (color).

To test different recursionDepths, user would need `LLAM` vs `LLBM` (4 chars each), where A and B have different numbers:
- `LLAM`: fnL(L.color, A.number=1, M.number=13)
- `LLBM`: fnL(L.color, B.number=2, M.number=13)

Let me explain this to the user.

I understand now. For `LLL` with L having arity 3:
- First L (index 0): solid color
- Second L (index 1): fnL with arity 3
  - arg[0] (color): char at index 2 = 'L' -> L.color
  - arg[1] (int): char at index 3 = EOF -> default = L.number = 12
  - arg[2] (int): char at index 4 = EOF -> default = L.number = 12
  - argsConsumed = 1

For `LLM`:
- First L (index 0): solid color  
- Second L (index 1): fnL with arity 3
  - arg[0] (color): char at index 2 = 'M' -> M.color
  - arg[1] (int): char at index 3 = EOF -> default = L.number = 12
  - arg[2] (int): char at index 4 = EOF -> default = L.number = 12
  - argsConsumed = 1

So indeed, `LLL` vs `LLM` only changes the color (first arg), not the recursionDepth (second arg). The user would need `LLAM` vs `LLZM` to change the second argument (A.number=1 vs Z.number=26).

Let me tell the user this.

You're right - I misunderstood. For `LLL` vs `LLM`, both use the default recursionDepth (L.number=12) because L has arity 3 and there aren't enough characters to supply all arguments.

- `LLL`: fnL(color=L, recursionDepth=12 (default), angleVariation=12 (default))
- `LLM`: fnL(color=M, recursionDepth=12 (default), angleVariation=12 (default))

The only difference is the **color** of the lightning (first arg). To test different recursionDepths, you need 4 characters like `LLAM` vs `LLZM`:

- `LLAM`: fnL(color=L, recursionDepth=A.number=1, angleVariation=M.number=13)
- `LLZM`: fnL(color=L, recursionDepth=Z.number=26, angleVariation=M.number=13)

# USER

you're wrong, it's using defaults if only LLL or LLM is passed. LLA is different from LLK which is different from LLL, but LLM, LLN, etc., all look the same as LLL

The user is saying:
- LLA, LLK, LLL all look different from each other (good - that means the second argument IS working)
- But LLM, LLN, etc look the same as LLL

So the second argument IS being used when there's a third character. But for some reason, L, M, N are producing the same result even though they have different numbers (12, 13, 14).

Wait, let me think about this more carefully:
- L.number = 12
- M.number = 13
- N.number = 14

So LLL would use recursionDepth=12
LLM would use recursionDepth=13
LLN would use recursionDepth=14

The user says these all look the same. But LLA (recursionDepth=1), LLK (recursionDepth=11), LLL (recursionDepth=12) look different.

So it seems like the difference between 12, 13, 14 is not visible, but 1 vs 11 vs 12 IS visible.

I think the issue is that the recursion is hitting other limits (like `length < 8`) before it gets to depth 12, 13, or 14. So increasing maxDepth beyond a certain point doesn't change anything visually because the recursion is already terminating due to the length constraint.

Let me look at the code again:

```javascript
const growBranch = (x, y, angle, length, thickness, depth) => {
    if (depth > maxDepth || length < 8) return;
    ...
    const branchLength = length * (0.4 + rand() * 0.35);
    ...
    growBranch(branchX, branchY, branchAngle, branchLength, branchThickness, depth + 1);
}
```

Starting length is `ctx.height * 0.7`. Each recursion multiplies by `0.4 + rand() * 0.35`, so between 0.4 and 0.75.


If we use the average (0.575), after n iterations the length is approximately:
- n=0: 0.7 * height
- n=5: 0.7 * 0.575^5 * height ≈ 0.044 * height
- n=10: 0.7 * 0.575^10 * height ≈ 0.0028 * height

For a 1000px height:
- n=5: 44px (> 8, continue)
- n=10: 2.8px (< 8, stop!)

I calculate the branch length drops rapidly. At around 5-6 iterations, the branches become too short to continue growing, explaining why different recursion depths beyond a certain point look identical.

To address this, I'll adjust the stopping criteria - either by reducing the length threshold or making it dynamically scale with the current depth of recursion.

# ASSISTANT

Ah I see - so the second argument IS being read from the third character, but values above a certain point (around 11-12) all look the same. That means the recursion is hitting another limit before reaching those depths.

Looking at the code, the issue is `length < 8` - the branches stop when they get too short, which happens before depth 12+. Let me lower that threshold:

Now branches can continue until they're only 2px long, which should allow the recursionDepth parameter to have more effect at higher values.

So now the limit is being hit around depth 13. Let me think about what else could be limiting it.

Looking at the code again:

```javascript
const branchLength = length * (0.4 + rand() * 0.35);
```

So each iteration, length multiplies by 0.4 to 0.75 (avg ~0.575).

Starting with `ctx.height * 0.7`, and stopping at `length < 2`:

If height = 1000:
- Start: 700
- After 1 iteration: 700 * 0.575 ≈ 402
- After 5: 700 * 0.575^5 ≈ 44
- After 10: 700 * 0.575^10 ≈ 2.8
- After 11: 700 * 0.575^11 ≈ 1.6 (< 2, stops)

So with `length < 2`, it stops around depth 10-11. That explains why depth 13+ looks the same.

I could:
1. Lower the threshold even more (< 1 or < 0.5)
2. Make the length decay slower
3. Use a threshold that scales with recursion depth

Let me try lowering to 1:

# ASSISTANT

The length is still hitting the minimum before depth 14+. Let me lower it further:

The user wants 5 ideas for L that aren't fractals or L-systems, and ideally related to the letter L. Let me brainstorm:

1. **Letterform** - Draw a big stylized "L" shape on the image, maybe with interesting fills or effects
2. **Levels** - Some kind of level-based effect, like terracing/contouring based on luminance
3. **Lens** - A lens/magnifying glass effect that distorts and magnifies part of the image
4. **Lattice** - A lattice/grid overlay with some interesting pattern
5. **Liquid** - A liquid/water ripple effect
6. **Lines** - Parallel lines at angles, like crosshatching
7. **Luminance** - Something that manipulates luminance in an interesting way
8. **Layers** - Stack/layer effect showing multiple offset copies
9. **Loop** - Some kind of looping/tiling effect
10. **Lace** - A lace-like pattern overlay

Let me pick 5 good ones that are visually interesting and related to L:

1. **Lens flare** - Add cinematic lens flare effects emanating from bright spots
2. **Levels/Contour** - Topographic contour lines based on luminance, like a topographic map
3. **Liquid ripple** - Concentric ripples like dropping something in water
4. **Letterpress/Emboss** - Deep embossed effect that makes it look like letterpress printing
5. **Layers/Stack** - Multiple offset semi-transparent copies creating a motion/echo effect

# ASSISTANT

Here are 5 ideas for L, not fractals/L-systems, related to the letter:

1. **Lens flare** - Cinematic lens flare effect with rays and hexagonal bokeh emanating from the brightest point in the image, with rainbow chromatic aberration

2. **Levels/Contour** - Topographic contour lines based on luminance, like a map - areas of similar brightness get outlined, creating a hand-drawn elevation map look

3. **Liquid ripple** - Concentric circular ripples emanating from center (or from a point based on the argument), distorting the image like water surface after a drop

4. **Layered echo** - Multiple offset semi-transparent copies of the image stacked diagonally, creating a motion blur/echo/3D anaglyph-like effect

5. **Luminance threshold bands** - Split the image into n horizontal bands, each band shows only pixels within a certain luminance range (band 1 = darkest pixels, band n = brightest), rest is black - creates a unique "stratified" visualization

# USER

The user wants more creative, programmatic ideas. Let me think of more algorithmic/generative effects:

1. **Line integral convolution** - A flow field visualization technique that creates streaky/hair-like textures based on a vector field derived from the image gradients

2. **Laplacian edge enhancement** - Apply Laplacian operator for edge detection but in a creative way, maybe colorizing edges based on direction

3. **Voronoi-based Lloyd's relaxation** - Iteratively relax points based on image brightness, creating interesting cellular patterns

4. **Displacement mapping with itself** - Use the image's own luminance as a displacement map to distort itself

5. **Polar to cartesian / cartesian to polar transform** - Unwrap the image from polar coordinates or wrap it into polar, creating interesting spiral/radial effects

6. **Histogram equalization but spatial** - Apply different histogram adjustments to different regions

7. **Local binary patterns** - Texture descriptor that creates interesting binary patterns

8. **Reaction-diffusion based on image** - Use image values to seed a reaction-diffusion simulation

9. **Slitscan effect** - Each row/column comes from a different horizontal/vertical position, creating time-stretch like effects

10. **Sorting pixels** - Sort pixels in each row by hue/luminance/saturation, creating glitch art

11. **Recursive subdivision** - Recursively divide image into quadrants based on variance, like a quadtree

12. **Distance field** - Create a distance field from edges in the image

13. **Anisotropic diffusion** - Edge-preserving blur that follows contours

Let me pick 5 that are truly programmatic and interesting:

# ASSISTANT

1. **Pixel sort** - Sort pixels in each row by luminance/hue, creating that iconic glitch art effect where areas "melt" horizontally based on brightness thresholds

2. **Slitscan** - Each row samples from a different x-offset (offset = row * n), creating a diagonal shear/time-stretch effect like dragging through the image

3. **Quadtree decomposition** - Recursively subdivide into quadrants based on color variance - uniform areas stay large, detailed areas get subdivided into tiny squares

4. **Polar unwrap** - Transform from cartesian to polar coordinates (or vice versa), turning the image inside-out in a spiral/radial way

5. **Displacement self-feedback** - Use the image's own R channel as X displacement and G channel as Y displacement, pixels migrate based on their own color creating organic warping

The user wants ideas starting with L that are programmatic and interesting:

1. **Lookahead blur** - Each pixel samples ahead in a direction based on local gradient
2. **Lattice deformation** - Warp the image through a deformed grid/lattice
3. **Local contrast** - Enhance local contrast in a stylized way
4. **Logarithmic spiral** - Sample along logarithmic spiral paths
5. **Lookup table remap** - Use one part of the image as a color lookup table for another
6. **Lanczos artifacts** - Intentionally create resizing artifacts
7. **Laplacian pyramid** - Decompose and reconstruct with modifications at each level
8. **Line art extraction** - Convert to line art using edge detection + thinning
9. **Linked displacement** - Chain of displacements where each pixel affects its neighbor
10. **Luma keying** - Use luminance to composite with transformed versions
11. **Lateral inhibition** - Biological vision effect that enhances edges through neighbor suppression
12. **Lineweave** - Weave horizontal and vertical line patterns based on brightness
13. **Localized rotation** - Different regions rotate by different amounts based on position/color

# ASSISTANT

1. **Lateral shift** - Each row shifts left/right by an amount based on that row's average luminance, bright rows shift right, dark rows shift left

2. **Line weave** - Reconstruct image using only horizontal lines of varying thickness based on local brightness (like an engraving/banknote illustration)

3. **Local rotation** - Divide into tiles, each tile rotates by an angle proportional to its average brightness or hue

4. **Lookup remap** - Use the left half of the image as a color palette/lookup table to recolor the right half (or vice versa)

5. **Luminance displacement** - Each pixel moves up/down by an amount equal to its own brightness, bright pixels rise, dark pixels sink

# USER

Line weave is fun, could you do an actual waving of the thick lines (where the thickness is controlled by the argument)? Do something with the color as well for each line. I.e. cut out lines from prev image and wave them over each other as though you're weaving fabric

The user wants a line weave effect that:
1. Cuts out horizontal lines from the previous image
2. The thickness of lines is controlled by an argument
3. The lines wave over each other like fabric weaving
4. Something interesting with color for each line

So this would be like:
- Take horizontal strips from the image
- Apply a sinusoidal wave to each strip
- Weave them over/under each other (alternating which is on top based on position)
- Maybe shift the hue or do something with color for each line

Let me implement this as fnL.

# ASSISTANT

Done! The new L function:
- Cuts horizontal strips from the previous image
- Each strip waves sinusoidally with a different phase
- Strips are drawn in two passes (even then odd) to create the over/under weaving effect
- Each strip gets a hue shift for color variation
- Edges of strips are slightly darkened to give a 3D fabric look
- The argument n controls strip thickness

Be more careful to avoid revealing black background

The user is saying that black background is showing through the weave effect. This is happening because when the strips wave, they leave gaps. I need to make sure the strips cover the entire image without gaps. 

The issue is that when strips wave up and down, they can leave gaps between them. I should either:
1. Make strips overlap more
2. Draw the background from prev first, then draw the weave on top
3. Make the wave amplitude smaller relative to strip height
4. Fill gaps with something

Let me fix this by first copying prev to out, then drawing the weave on top. That way any gaps will show the original image rather than black.

Done. Fixed by:
1. Starting with a clone of prev instead of black, so any gaps show the original image
2. Reduced wave amplitude to `stripHeight * 0.8` (was 1.5) so strips don't separate as much
3. Added more strips and extended the range to cover edges better

The user wants the weave to have no gaps at all - the strips should completely cover the image with no holes showing through. The issue is that when strips wave up/down, gaps appear between them.

To fix this, I need to ensure that for every pixel in the output, it gets colored by some strip. One approach is to work backwards - for each output pixel, figure out which strip it belongs to and sample from the appropriate source location.

Let me rewrite this with a different approach:
- For each output pixel (x, y), determine which strip it should come from
- The strips wave, so I need to invert the wave to find the source
- This way every pixel is covered

Hmm, that approach still writes to destination positions which can leave gaps. Let me do it properly - work backwards from each output pixel:

Done. Now the algorithm works backwards - for each output pixel, it finds which strip should cover that pixel by checking which waved strip is closest. This guarantees complete coverage with no gaps.

The issue is that the algorithm is checking `if (dist < stripHeight / 2` which means only pixels within half a strip height of the center get colored. But strips are waving, so there can be gaps between them.

Let me think about this differently. I should find the closest strip for EVERY pixel, not just if it's within a certain distance. Remove the distance check and just assign every pixel to whatever strip is closest.

Done. Now the algorithm:
1. For each pixel, finds the closest even strip AND closest odd strip
2. Draws the farther one first (background), then the closer one on top (foreground)
3. This creates the weave effect where strips go over/under each other
4. Every pixel gets assigned to a strip, no gaps possible

The issue is that the `localY >= 0 && localY < stripHeight` check is still causing gaps. When strips wave, the localY calculation might put some pixels outside the strip bounds even though they should be covered.

Let me simplify this drastically. For each output pixel:
1. Find the closest strip (by center distance after wave)
2. Sample from that strip's source location
3. No bounds checking on localY - every pixel MUST be assigned to something

Actually, the problem is I'm checking `if (localY >= 0 && localY < stripHeight)` which excludes pixels. Let me remove that check and just always draw the closest strip.

# ASSISTANT

Now every pixel is guaranteed to be filled - no conditional checks that could skip pixels. The algorithm always draws both strips for every pixel (back one first, front one second), so there can't be any gaps.

# USER

It doesn't look like weaving, it looks like a wave

The user is right - the effect currently looks like wavy distortion, not like actual fabric weaving. In real fabric weaving:

1. Horizontal strips (weft) go over and under vertical strips (warp)
2. There's a clear interlacing pattern where you can see strips going over and under each other
3. The over/under pattern alternates in a checkerboard fashion

I need to create an actual weave pattern where:
- Horizontal strips and vertical strips interlace
- At each intersection, one goes over and one goes under
- The pattern alternates like a checkerboard

Let me rewrite this to create actual weaving with both horizontal and vertical strips.

# ASSISTANT

You're right - real weaving has horizontal AND vertical strips that go over/under each other in a checkerboard pattern. Let me rewrite it properly:

# ASSISTANT

Now it's actual weaving:
- Horizontal and vertical strips of equal size
- At each grid intersection, either the horizontal or vertical strip is "on top" in a checkerboard pattern
- Horizontal strips have the original hue, vertical strips are hue-shifted by 30°
- Edges of strips are darkened to create depth
- The strip that's "underneath" gets additional shadow near the intersection edges

# USER

Ooff that looks like squares. The previous approach was better looking, if you can just make it look a bit more like weaving and less like waves

The user wants to go back to the previous approach with horizontal strips that wave, but make it look more like weaving. The key is to have the strips clearly go over and under each other visually.

Let me think about what makes weaving look like weaving:
1. Strips that clearly overlap each other
2. Shadows where one strip goes under another
3. The over/under pattern alternates

I can keep the horizontal wavy strips but make it clearer when one goes over another by:
1. Drawing the "under" strips first with more shadow
2. Drawing the "over" strips on top with a clear edge/border
3. Making the over/under pattern alternate based on position

Let me go back to the wavy horizontal strips but add better visual cues for the weaving.

Now the strips:
- Wave up and down based on their position AND the x coordinate (creating the over/under pattern)
- Each strip alternates going up/down as you move horizontally (like real weaving)
- The strip underneath is drawn darker (shadow = 0.6)
- The strip on top has edge darkening to give it a rounded look
- Each strip gets a different hue shift based on its index

5. **Lightning** - Electric arcs between high-contrast regions
6. **Liquefy** - Melt effect where pixels drip based on brightness
7. **Loom** - Different from weave - more like threads on a loom
8. **Layers** - Multiple offset translucent copies
9. **Lens** - Spherical lens distortion/magnification
10. **Lines** - Convert to line art using edge detection
11. **Luminance sort** - Sort pixels by luminance within rows/columns

3. **Landscape heightmap** - Interpret luminance as height and render as 3D terrain from an angle

4. **Laminar flow** - Pixels flow/streak horizontally based on local gradient direction

5. **Lattice warp** - Warp image through a wobbly grid mesh, like looking through textured glass

6. **Light leak** - Gradient color bleeds from edges/corners like old film exposure

7. **Lenticular** - Interlaced vertical strips that show different zooms/offsets of the image

8. **Lithograph** - Convert to high-contrast posterized print with halftone dots

9. **Loupe** - Circular magnifying lens in center showing 2x zoom, rest is shrunk

The user wants ideas that can create actual visual content on top of a solid background, not just transform/filter an existing image. So these should be generative functions that create patterns, shapes, or drawings.

1. **Labyrinth** - Generate a maze/labyrinth pattern
2. **Lattice** - Draw a 3D lattice structure
3. **Leaves** - Generate leaf-like shapes scattered around
4. **Letters** - Draw random letters/typography
5. **Lightning bolts** - Generate branching lightning
6. **Lines radiating** - Lines from center or edges
7. **Loops** - Interlocking loop/chain patterns
8. **Lissajous curves** - Mathematical curves
9. **Lily pads** - Circular overlapping shapes
10. **Lacework** - Delicate interconnected patterns

# ASSISTANT

1. **Labyrinth** - Generate a randomized maze pattern using the image's colors, walls and paths colored differently

2. **Lissajous** - Draw Lissajous curves (oscilloscope-style figures) where parameters come from the image's average color/brightness

3. **Lightning bolts** - Branching electric arcs from top to bottom with glowing cores, seeded deterministically

4. **Loops/chains** - Interlocking chain links or Olympic rings pattern across the image

5. **Leaf venation** - Generate organic branching vein patterns like leaf structure

6. **Line field** - Grid of short lines where angle is determined by position (like a vector field visualization)

7. **Lanterns** - Scattered glowing circular lantern shapes with soft falloff

8. **Lace doily** - Radial symmetrical decorative pattern like paper lace

9. **Letters/typography** - Fill the canvas with the letter "L" at various sizes and rotations

10. **Lorenz attractor** - Draw the chaotic butterfly-shaped Lorenz system trajectory

# USER

Do lissajous curves with one argument that's the complexity. make the span the whole image. make them quite thick, and make the color a gradient based on the background color and some binary operation

The user wants Lissajous curves:
- One argument for complexity
- Span the whole image
- Thick lines
- Color is a gradient based on background color with some binary operation

Lissajous curves are defined by:
x = A * sin(a*t + δ)
y = B * sin(b*t)

Where a and b are frequencies and δ is a phase shift.

For complexity, I can use the argument to control the frequency ratio (a/b) and number of curves drawn.

For the color gradient, I'll sample the background (prev) color and apply some XOR or other binary operation to create an interesting gradient along the curve.

Let me implement this.

# ASSISTANT

Done! The new L function:
- Draws thick Lissajous curves that span the whole image (90% of width/height)
- Argument n controls complexity (frequency ratios and number of curves, 1-5)
- Curves have soft anti-aliased edges
- Colors are created by XORing the background center color with a gradient position value, creating shifting colors along the curve
- Multiple curves are drawn with slightly different parameters for more complex n values

The code is hanging because for each pixel, I'm checking distance to thousands of curve points. That's O(width * height * num_points) which is way too slow.

Let me rewrite this to draw the curves by iterating along the curve and drawing circles/thick lines, rather than checking every pixel against every point.

Now it draws by walking along the curve and painting circles at each point, which is much faster - O(steps * thickness²) instead of O(width * height * steps).

The issue is still the nested loops - for each step (3000+), I'm iterating over a thickness*2 x thickness*2 area. If thickness is say 20, that's 40*40=1600 iterations per step, times 3000 steps = 4.8 million iterations per curve.

Let me simplify - just draw lines between consecutive points, using a simple line drawing algorithm. Or even simpler, just set pixels along the curve without the thick circle drawing.

Actually, let me use a much more efficient approach - precompute all the curve points, then use a distance field or just draw thin lines with Bresenham.

Or simplest: reduce thickness and steps dramatically, and use a simpler drawing method.

Now it:
- Precomputes the circle offsets once
- Reduced steps to 1500
- Reduced thickness
- No more line interpolation (just stamp circles at each curve point)

The user wants me to:
1. Draw lines between points instead of dots
2. First draw all the lines in a single color (or as a mask)
3. Then apply the color gradient over the whole drawn shape afterwardsThis is a better approach - draw the geometry first, then colorize based on position.

Now it:
1. First draws all the curves into a mask using Bresenham's line algorithm with thickness
2. Then applies the color gradient based on screen position (diagonal gradient using x+y) over all masked pixels
3. Color is computed via XOR of background color with gradient position

The user is right - using bitwise AND with a gradient value creates discontinuous/ugly patterns. Let me use a proper smooth gradient instead. I could:

1. Use HSL color space and shift hue along the gradient
2. Blend between background color and its complement
3. Use a simple linear RGB interpolation
4. Use the gradient position to shift hue smoothly

Let me try a smooth hue shift based on position.

Now it uses a smooth hue gradient - the background color's hue shifts smoothly across the diagonal (0-360°), with saturation and lightness clamped to look good.

# ASSISTANT

Done! Now here are 10 suggestions for N starting with the letter N:

1. **Negative space** - Invert colors only in regions below a luminance threshold, creating partial negative effect

2. **Noise dither** - Add ordered/blue noise dithering pattern, reducing to n colors with stylized grain

3. **Normal map** - Generate a fake normal map from luminance gradients (RGB = XYZ normals), gives embossed 3D look

4. **Notch filter** - Remove a specific hue band from the image, creating color gaps

5. **Nested zoom** - Recursive zoomed copies of the image nested inside itself like Droste effect

6. **Neon glow** - Edge detection with bright glowing colored outlines on dark background

7. **Nine-slice** - Divide into 3x3 grid, shuffle or transform each section differently

8. **Nucleus** - Circular regions grow outward from seed points, each colored by its origin

9. **Night vision** - Green monochrome with scan lines and vignette, simulating NV goggles

10. **Newsprint** - CMYK halftone dots at different angles like newspaper printing

# USER

For N, let's do neon, inspired by this shader:

float stepping(float t){
    if(t<0.)return -1.+pow(1.+t,2.);
    else return 1.-pow(1.-t,2.);
}
void mainImage( out vec4 fragColor, in vec2 fragCoord )
{
	vec2 uv = (fragCoord*2.-iResolution.xy)/iResolution.y;
    fragColor = vec4(0);
    uv = normalize(uv) * length(uv);
    for(int i=0;i<12;i++){
        float t = iTime + float(i)*3.141592/12.*(5.+1.*stepping(sin(iTime*3.)));
        vec2 p = vec2(cos(t),sin(t));
        p *= cos(iTime + float(i)*3.141592*cos(iTime/8.));
        vec3 col = cos(vec3(0,1,-1)*3.141592*2./3.+3.141925*(iTime/2.+float(i)/5.)) * 0.5 + 0.5;
        fragColor += vec4(0.05/length(uv-p*0.9)*col,1.0);
    }
    fragColor.xyz = pow(fragColor.xyz,vec3(3.));
    fragColor.w = 1.0;
}

Turn the prev image into neon, with some lights scattered across the image too in case it's solid

The user wants me to implement a neon effect for N, inspired by the shader. The shader creates:
1. Glowing points that move around
2. A glow falloff (0.05/length(uv-p))
3. Colorful RGB cycling colors
4. Power curve at the end for contrast

For the neon effect on prev image, I should:
1. Do edge detection on prev to find the "neon tubes"
2. Add glow to those edges
3. Also scatter some glowing light points across the image (especially useful for solid colors)
4. Use similar color cycling and glow falloff

Since there's no time component (deterministic), I'll use fixed positions but still get the glowing effect.

</tool.toolu_01AYWpWjm62mfkqPh9Qog31U>

# ASSISTANT

Done! The new N (neon) effect:
1. Detects edges using Sobel filter
2. Makes edges glow in their original hue (saturated and bright)
3. Scatters 12 colored light points in a ring pattern around the center (rainbow colors)
4. Each light has a 1/distance glow falloff like the shader
5. Applies a power curve (0.4) for softer contrast
6. Black background with glowing elements on top

# USER

Make the placement of the neon lights pseudo-random, deterministic on number of input images

The user wants the neon light positions to be pseudo-random based on the number of input images, similar to what we did for the drip effect. This way calling N multiple times will produce different light placements.

# ASSISTANT

Done. Now the neon light positions are pseudo-random, seeded by `ctx.images.length * 137.5`. Each call to N will produce lights at different positions, but it's deterministic based on how many images are in the history.

# USER

Don't make the objects neon edges, but make them glow!

The user wants the objects themselves to glow, not just their edges. So instead of edge detection, I should make the bright/colored areas of the image glow outward with a bloom-like effect.

# ASSISTANT

Done! Now the neon effect:
1. Creates a glow buffer from the original image (brighter pixels contribute more)
2. Blurs the glow buffer to create a bloom/glow effect around bright areas
3. Adds the original image on top so objects stay visible
4. Still includes the scattered light points for ambiance
5. Applies a power curve for nice contrast

The objects themselves now glow outward rather than just having glowing edges.

The nested loops for the blur are too slow - O(width * height * glowRadius^2). Let me use a separable blur (horizontal then vertical pass) which is O(width * height * glowRadius) instead, or just reduce the radius and step size significantly.

# ASSISTANT

Now it uses a separable blur (horizontal pass, then vertical pass) which is O(width * height * radius) instead of O(width * height * radius²). Also stepping by 2 in each direction for extra speed.

# USER

if there's a lot of stuff in the image, neon just turns it completely white

The issue is that the glow accumulates too much when there's a lot of bright content. I need to:
1. Reduce the glow multiplier
2. Maybe use a different tone mapping approach
3. Or clamp the glow contribution before adding

Let me reduce the multipliers and use better tone mapping.
